F1 Garage Manager

F1 Garage Manager is an academic project developed for the course CE-3101 – Database Systems, focused on the design and implementation of a relational database system for managing a Formula 1 garage environment.

The project emphasizes correct database modeling, normalization, and enforcement of business rules through a structured and scalable design.

Project Description

The system is designed to manage core entities involved in a Formula 1 context, including teams, cars, drivers, sponsors, parts, configurations (setups), and race simulations.
Special attention is given to ensuring data consistency, referential integrity, and alignment with real-world business constraints of the domain.

The database layer is implemented using Microsoft SQL Server and is based on a formally defined Entity–Relationship (ER) model and its corresponding logical representation.

Scope and Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

Design a coherent and normalized relational database model.

Translate the conceptual ER model into a logical schema with tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

Enforce essential business rules at the database level.

Provide dummy data to validate relationships and verify correctness of the model.

Prepare the system for future integration with application layers and advanced database logic.

Database Design

The database design includes:

Clearly defined entities and relationships based on the project domain.

Proper use of primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) to ensure referential integrity.

Resolution of many-to-many relationships through intermediate tables.

Basic constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK to enforce data validity.

Separation between structural definitions (schema) and test data (dummy inserts).

The schema has been implemented and validated using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Development Notes

All data used in the project is fictional and intended solely for academic and testing purposes.

The database scripts are designed to be reproducible and executable in a clean environment.

The project follows good practices in database organization and documentation.

The database layer is kept independent from the frontend to ensure modularity.
